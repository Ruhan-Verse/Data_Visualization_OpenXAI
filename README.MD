## ðŸ”Ž Insights
- **Gender effect:** Female passengers had a much higher survival rate than males.  
- **Class effect:** Passengers in 1st class survived more than those in 2nd and 3rd.  
- **Age effect:** Children and younger passengers had better survival rates.  
- **Fare effect:** Higher fares (correlated with class) generally meant better survival chances.  
- **Combined effects:** Being a female in 1st class gave the highest survival probability, while males in 3rd class had the lowest.
